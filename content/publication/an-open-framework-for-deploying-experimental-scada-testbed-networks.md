abstract = "A scalable framework for automatically deploying locally (or remotely) a number of virtual machines that replicate a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) network is proposed. This includes multiple virtual hosts emulating sensors and actuators, with a Human Machine Interface (HMI) controlling the hosts. The presented framework contains a collection of automation scripts which build and deploy a variable number of virtual machines, pre-configured to act as either a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU), HMI or Data Historian. The presented work includes a standards compliant implementation of IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC104) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC-UA), with the capability to support other protocols such as Modbus-TCP (Modbus) and IEC61850. This allows researchers to build testbeds that can be configured to replicate realworld deployments of SCADA networks. The framework builds upon open source libraries and is released under the Free Software Foundation approved licence, GNU General Public License version 3."
