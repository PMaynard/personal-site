abstract = "Current state-of-the-art intrusion detection and network monitoring systems have a tendency to focus on the 'Five-Tuple' features (protocol, IP src/dst and port src/dest). As a result there is a gap in visibility of security at an application level. We propose a collection of network application layer metrics to provide a greater insight into SCADA communications. These metrics are devised from an analysis of the industrial control system (ICS) threat landscape and the current state-of-the-art detection systems. Our metrics are able to detect a range of adversary capabilities which goes beyond previous literature in the SCADA domain."
