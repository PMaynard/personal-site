abstract = "Current Linux Application Firewall (LAF) implementations, do not take full advantage of the Linux kernel. Which results in a bad experience for end users, ultimately, leaving the idea dead in the water. Background chatter on the Internet, shows there is an interest in a desktop application firewall, that can provide the average user with an additional layer of security. While expert users advocate the use of complex Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems, such as SELinux and AppArmor to provide the same level of protection. This work attempts to find a middle ground between the two."
